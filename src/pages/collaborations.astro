            The collaboration criterion was one of the most enjoyable for many
            of us. iGem collaborations highlight the synergistic, and not
            antagonistic, spirit that characterises the competition. We found
            ourselves amazed at how seemingly difficult problems can have
            surprisingly simple solutions when consulting fellow iGEMmers which
            shared with us their unique point of view and vice versa. After all,
            &ldquo;together we stand, divided we fall&rdquo;. Collaborations
            enabled us to take a peep at the wonderful work of the iGEM teams we
            collaborated with, learn from their achievements and wrongdoings and
            get familiar with their tactics and methods. All of these would not
            have been possible to that great extent, without each team
            triggering and being triggered by the others, by virtue of the
            Collaboration criterion. The whole experience was an amazing journey
            in which we learned a lot, and had so much fun!
            <br />
            We couldn't wait to exchange ideas, opinions and maybe form friendships
            with people our age from every corner of the earth. Here is a map showing
            the countries where iGEMTeams, we had the pleasure of working with, are
            located!

          <p>
            iGEM USAFA took the initiative to make a beautiful colouring book in
            order to make the concept of each project more accessible to young
            children by distributing the book to schools. The idea intrigued us
            and so we decided to participate, sending a drawing that describes
            our project and a short description of our project like a fairytale,
            so that it can be understood by little kids.

            iGEM MSP Maastricht reached out to us about a very interesting idea
            they had in order to make the significance of projects clearer to
            people from various social groups. We were thus very happy that we
            contributed to the creation of a puzzle book that included a
            well-liked overview of our initiative and ten words that are
            particularly meaningful to each member of our team.

          <p>
            We planned a visit to a high school to forward our goals of making
            our work understandable to both young and elderly. So, we presented
            our project to the kids and their instructors. Moreover, we aimed to
            convey to them the spirit of the competition and the encouragement
            of inter-team collaboration.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, we contacted various other fellow teams and worked
            together&nbsp; in order to produce a poster on which each group
            translated the quote: &ldquo;The important thing is to never stop
            questioning (or learning)&rdquo; credited to Albert Einstein in
            their respective language. This collaboration was really exciting
            for all of us and we couldn't wait to share the outcome with the
            children!

            We also took a break to visit the sea and participate in the
            Netlantis UCPH team's amazing promotion video! One member of our
            team took a video as they stood in front of that particular water
            body and said the emotion that emerges from it. So, the word that we
            chose is serenity, or as we said it in our native language:

            Safety Collage with iGEM Thessaly, iGEM Patras, iGEM Athens
          </h1>
          <p>
            On the occasion of the World Day for Safety and Health at Work, we
            decided to organise a collaboration to promote the message that no
            condition should violate people's rights to safe work: a concept
            that is often undervalued and should concern the research field
            more. Therefore, we decided that a safety collage would be a simple
            and entertaining approach to spread this message. Hence, we got in
            touch with the safety manager of each team in order to provide us
            with some information about why maintaining safety in the lab space
            is so crucial. Consequently, a fantastic collage and an even better
            message resulted from this lovely teamwork.

            As a team we placed a lot of emphasis on the 17 Sustainability

            come closer to their achievement. Consequently, we were thrilled
            when iGEM Patras Med contacted us about working together to create a

            that they can have enough data to work with. They used the data to
            be able to direct their approach as for communicating their project
            to the general public and to implement their project in the best
            possible way.

            We sent an article of 300 words to iGEM of UNSW to assist with their

            importance of the applications of synthetic biology and how they can
            benefit us all by reducing malnutrition in developing countries.
            Moreover, the article was translated in Greek, as an effort to make

            The World Environment Day inspired us to invite iGEM teams to help
            us honor its importance! Our goal was to raise awareness about the
            environmental importance of buying locally, since it reduces the
            miles travelled by products, the so called &ldquo;food miles'', and
            consequently the pollution created by transportation. So we asked
            for pictures of local shops and shared them creating a relevant
            Instagram post of a coffee shop that a member of our team owns, and
            of a food shop from team iGEM IISER Tirupati, that replied to our
            calling.

            students educated and updated us according to the iGEM competition,
            how to properly lead an iGEM team and to acquire medals. Patras P.I.
