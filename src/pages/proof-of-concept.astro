            For the development of our project we ensured that we provided
            sufficient evidence that our system is functional. During the whole
            duration of our experiments we ensured that we keep safety as the
            number one priority. We also tried to keep results for each one of
            our experimental procedures to strengthen the transparency of our
            concept.

          <p>
            After countless brainstorming sessions we ended up in our project
            idea, ATROPA, which is basically a diagnostic tool utilizing LRRs
            for TSWV diagnosis. The first step was to test in silico that our
            idea has a potential and this is where our project modeling came in.

            Our predictions really showed us that there is actually interaction
            between the LRR domain of Sw-5b resistance gene and the Nsm<sup
              >115-135</sup
            >. This was the confirmation we needed to proceed with the
            experimental part of our project.

          <h1 class="part-title">Experimental planing</h1>
          <p>
            Before the lab work was initiated, we shared our plans with both our
            supervisor and our advisors. After getting critical feedback and
            insights from them we started planning our experimental procedures.
            When the planning was over we again consulted them and optimized
            every step of the process. This is when the actual experiments were
            ready to begin.

          <p>
            As mentioned before results from all of the steps of our experiments
            were collected to properly display the progress of our project. The
            final experiment showed positive results and the proof of concept
            for our project was established. In particular, after incubating the <strong
              ><em>E.coli</em>
            </strong>cells which were surface displaying the LRR and the NB-LRR
            of SW-5b resistance gene of <strong
              ><em>Solanum Peruvianum</em>
            </strong><em>,</em> with the protein extract from <strong
              ><em>N. Sylvestris</em>
            </strong>leaves expressing the Nsm<sup>115-135</sup> viral protein fused
            with YFP, we observed fluorescence in the samples. This means that our
            <em>E.coli</em>cells have the ability to bind this protein.

          <p>
            Overall we managed to show that our system of surface displaying
            cells are capable of binding our target effector protein, while
            E.coli surface displaying random peptides did not. In our opinion
            this is a novel approach to reconsider diagnostic toolâ€™s basic
            elements. We think that whole-cell based diagnostic tools can
            significantly lower the price of production while providing the
            affinity and specificity of antibody-based systems.
